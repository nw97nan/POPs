# POPs: Propensity Optimised Paths
This is the official repository of POPs, a method to compute and score paths of optimised propensity that link the orthosteric site with the identified allosteric sites, and identifies crucial residues that contribute to those paths based on results from [bond-to-bond propensity analysis] (https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms12477).
